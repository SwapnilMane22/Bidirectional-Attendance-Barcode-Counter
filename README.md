# Bidirectional-Attendance-Barcode-Counter
Attendance tracking app for businesses, associations and schools to track employees, members and students tracking services to check-in, check-out and control access for administrators with smartphones and tablets.

Components Required:-
1. Arduino UNO/Mega
2. 16x2 LCD Display
3. Buzzer
4. 2 LM393-IR sensors: To make the counter high and low for bi-directional attendance
5. Bluetooth Module-HC05: This module is used to connect the hardware system to the the software app for the synchronization of barcode counter with the IR counter and validate the same
6. 10Kohm potentiometer to adjust the LCD brightness and make use of it for power saving modes(if required)
7. Two push switch buttons for Send the data i.e. uploading and another for reseting the counter

LM393-IR sensors can be replaced by Ultrasonic Sensors for better coverage of range.Wi-fi module could be used instead of HC-05 with areas of high speed wi-fi access for direct updation of attendance to the database.

Connections for connecting LCD to arduino are listed as below:-
